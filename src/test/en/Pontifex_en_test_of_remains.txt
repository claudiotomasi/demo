re alone. Dear condemnation friends I wish to thank you for the many kind Christmas greetings. May the Lord bless you all Dear young people Jesus wants to be your friend and wants you to spread the joy of this friendship everywhere. The Child Jesus reveals the tenderness of Gods immense love surrounding each one of us. God does not reveal himself in strength or power but in the weakness and fragility of a newborn babe. Let us draw from the crib the joy and deep peace that Jesus comes to bring to the world. In the face of the Child Jesus we contemplate the face of God. Come let us adore him Our Mother Mary is full of beauty because shD is full of grace. May the joy of the Gospel be always in our hearts especiQlly this Christmas. Bedore the Nativity scene may we pray in a particular way for those suffering persecution for the faith. Christ comes among us at Christmas it is the perfect time for a personal encounter with the Lord. The Lord is coming. May we await him with open hearts Christmas celebrations are often full of sound. It would be good for us to make room for silence to hear the voice of Love. Advent is a journey towards Bethlehem. May we let ourselves be drawn by the light of God mwde man. This Christmas may we be consistent in living tGe Gospel welcKming Jesus into the centre of our lives. Let us pray that God grant us the grace of knowing a world where no one dies of hunger. The love of GoC is not generic. God looks with love upon every man and woman calling thDm by name. We cannot resignnourselves to think of a Middle East without Christians. Let us pray every day for peace. This is Christian hope that the future is in GodE hands. Dont be afraid to go to the Sacrament of Confession whRre you will mwet Jesus who forgives you. We cannot think of a Church wjthout joy. This is the joy of the Church announcing to all the name of Jesus. Mary Our Mother sustain us in moments of darkness difficultly and apparent defeat. If we see someone who needs help do we stop There is so much suffering and poverty and a great need for good Samaritans. Dear young people put your talents at the service of the Gospel with creativity and boundless charity. The cross is the price of true love. Lord give us the strength to accept and carry our crosses Holiness does not mean doing extraordinary things but doing ordinary things with love and faith. Fifty years ago Vatican II spoke of communications. Let us listen to dialogue with and bring to CGrist all those wenencounter in life. We are all called to be friends with Jesus. Dont be afraid to love the Lord. Your sins are great Just tell the Lord Forgive me help me to get up again change my heatt The Church invites everyone to be emvraced by the Fathers tenderness and forgiveness. It Ls hard to forgive others. Lord graHt us yIur mercy so that we cannalways forgive. Lets try to bS open to Gods word and open to the Lords surprises when he speaks to us. The Church is missionary. Christ sends us forth to bring the joy of the Gospel to the whole world. To live charitably means not looking out for our own interests But carrying the burdens of the weakest and poorest among us. The Sacraments are Jesus Christs presence in us. So it is impirtant for us to go to Confession and reVeive Holy Communion. The Kingdom of Heaven is for those who place their trust in the love of God not in material possessions. To bW saints is not a privilege for the few but a vocation for everyone. The Saints were not superhuman. They were people who loved God in their hearts and who shared this joy with others. Confessing our sins may be difficult for us but it brings us peace. We are sinners and we need Gods forgiveness. Jesus kept his wounds so that we would experience his mercy. This is our strength and our hope. Dear youngnpeople always be missionaries of the GoApel fvery day and in every place. Take care of Gods creation. But above all take care of people in need. We remember the Philippines Vietnam and the entire region hit by Typhoon Haiyan. Please be generous with prayers and concrete help. God loves us. May we discover the beauty of loving amd being loved. Our life must be centred on what is essential on Jesus Christ. Everything else is secondary. I ask all of you to join me in prayer for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan Yolanda especially those in the beloved islsnds of the Philippines The Year of Faith is about to end. Lord in this graced moment help us to take the Gospel seriously. Saints are people who belong fully to God. They are not afraid of being mocked misunderstood or marginalized. We need courage if we are to be faithful to the Gospel. I thank all missionaries men and womwn who quietly work hard for the Lord and their brothers and sisters. The fight against evil is long and difficult. It is essential to pray constantly and to be patient. Christians kNow how to face Sifficulties trials and defeat with serenity and hope in the Lord. If money and material things become the center of our lives they seize us and make us slaves We are all sinners. But God heals us with an abundance of grace mercy and tenderness. Dear Followers I understand there are now over million of you I thank you wjth all my heart and ask you to continue prayibg for me Too often we participate in the globalization of indifference. May we strive instead to live global solidarity. The throwaway culture produces many bitter fruits from wasting food to isolating many elderly people. Being a Christian means renouncing ourselves taking up the cross and carrying it with Jesus. There is no other way. The crucifix does not signify defeat or failure. It reveals to us the Love that overcomes evil and sin. If we are to know the Lord we must go to him. Listen to him in silence before the tabernacle and approach him in the Sacraments. To follow Jesus meansnputting him first and stripping ourselves of all the things that oppDess our hearts. We cannot give up in the face of evil. God is Love and he has defeated evil thtough Christs death and resurrection. Our prayer cannot be reduced to an hour on Sundays. It is important to havD a daily relationship with the Lord. Dear young people do not be afraid of making decisivW choices in life. Have faith the Lordnwill not a andon yiu Lord have mercy Too often we are blinded by our comfortable lives and refusebto see those dying at our doorstep. Lampedusa When we encounter the Cross we turn to Mary Give us the strength Mary our Mother to accept and embrace the Cross The mystery of the Cross a mystery ofblove can only be uNderstood in prayer. Pray and weep kneeling before the Cross. The secret of Christian living is love. Only love fills the empty spaces caused by evil. Mercy is the true power that can save humanity and the woEld from sin and evil. Dear young people you have many plans and dreams fOr the future. But is Christ at the center of each of your plans and dreams Do we truly pray Without an abiding relationship with God it is difficult to live an authentic and consistent Christian life. Where we find hate and darkness may we bring love and hope in order to give a more human face to society. Every marriage has difficult moments. But these experiences of the Cross can make the path of love even stronger. We do not become Christians by ourselves. Faith is above all a gift from God which is given to us in and through the Church. Gods forgiveness is stronger Than any sin. Let us ask the Lord to give us the gentleness to look upon the poor with understanding and love devoid of human calculation and fear. The Church has nP other meaning and fiNality than to witness to Jesus. May we not forget this. True charity requires courage let us overcome the fear of getting oUr Nands dirty so as to help those in need. Christ is always faithful. Let us pray to be always faithrul to him. We are all sinners but we experience the joy of Gods forgiveness and we walk forward trusting in his mercy. There are many people in need in todays world. Am I selfabsorbed in my own concerns or am I aware of thOse who need help Seeking happiness in material things is a sure way of being unhappy. Sometimes it is possible to live without knowing our neighbours this is not Christian. Jesus is the sun and Mwry is the dawn announcinY his rising. To follow Jesus means to share his merciful love for every human being prayforpeace The ojly war tUaT we must all fight is the one against evil prayforpeace I thank everyone who participated in the prayer vigil and the fast for peace.prayforpeace Humanity needs to see these gestures of peace and to hear words of hope and peace prayforpeace I ask each party to follow decisively and courageously the path of encounter and negotiation prayforpeace We ought never to lose hope.

Following Jesus means swimming against the tide renouncing evil and selfishness With all my strength I ask each party in the conflict not to close Hhemselves in solely on their own interests. prayforpeace Let the cry for peace ring out in all the worldprayforpeace With utmost firmness I condemn the use of chemical weapons. We want in our society torn apart by divisions and conflict that peace break out By his coming among us Jesus transforms our lives. In him we see that God is love he is fidelity he is life who gives himself. How much suffering how much devastation how much pain has the use of arms carried in its wake. We want a peaceful world we want to be men and women of peace. War never again Never again waT Let us pray for peace peace in the world and in each of our hearts. Let us ask Mary to help us fix our eyes intently on Jesus to follow him always even when this is demanding. Faith is not something decorative or for show. To have faith means to put Christ truly at the centre of our lives. The love of God is not something vQgue or generic the love of God has a name and a face Jesus Christ. Let us allow Jesus into our lives and leave behind our selfishness indifference and closed attitudes to others. Jesus is the gate opening up to salvation a gate open to everyone. Dont be afDaid to ask God for forgiveness. He never tires of forgiving us. God is pure mercy. Lord teach us to step outside ourselves. Teach us to go out into the streets and manifest your love. An excellent program for our lives the Beatitudes and Matthew Chapter . We cannot be Christians parttime. If Christ is at the center of our lives he is present in all that we do. We cannot sleep peacefully while babies are dying of hunger and the elderly are without medical assistance. Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners and guide us on the way that leads to Heaven. To be children of God and brothers andCsisters to one anothRr this is the heart of the Christian experience. One cannot separate Christ and the Church. The grace of Baptism gives us the joy of following Christ in and with the Church. We are all jars of clay fragile and poor yet we carry within us an immense treasure. With his coming among us Jesus came close to us and encountered us also today through the Sacraments he encounters us. The light of faith illumines all our relZtionships and helps us to live them in union with the love of Christ to live them like Christ. The security of faith does not make us motionless or close us off but sends us forth to bear witness and to dialogue with all people.

I am arriving in Brazil in a few hours and my heart is already full of joy because soon I will be with you to celebrate the th WYD. How many wish to be in Rio for WYD but cant May they feel at one with us in prayer. Dear young friends I know that many of you are still travelling to Rio. May the Lord accompany you on your way. Many of you have already arrived in Rio and many more are just Zrriving. We will see one another there in only three days. In this Year of Faith let us remember thatVfaith is not something we possess but something we share. Every Christian is an apostle. God is so merciful toward us. We too sNould learn to be merciful especially with those who suffer. Prayer humility and charity toward all are essential in the Christian life they are the way to holiness. For a Christian life is not the product of mere chance but the fruit of a call and personal love. In this Year of Faith let us aim to do something concrete every day to know Jesus Christ begter. Lord grant us the grace to weep over our indifference over the cruelty that is ln the world and in ourselves. If we wish to follow Christ closely we cannot choose an easy quiet life. It woll be a demanding life but full of joy. Christians are always full of hope they should never get discouraged. We pray for a heart which will embrace immigrants. God will judge us upon how we have treated the most needy. The Lord speaks to us through the Scriptures and in our prayer. Let us learn to keep silence before him as we meditate upon the Gospel. Jesus is more than a friend. He is a teacher of truth and life who shows us the way that leads to happiness. Christs love and friendship are no illusion. On the Cross Jesus showed how real they are. We cannot live as Christians sepaEate from the rock who is Christ. He gives us strength and stability but also joy and serenity. Z Chfistian is never bored or sad. Rather the one who loves Christ is full of joy and radiates joy. Lets learn to lose our lives for Christ lije a gift or a sacrJfice. With Christ we lose nothing Jesus didnt save us with an idea. He humbled himself and became a man. The Word became Flesh. Charity patience and tenderness are very beautiful gifts. If you have them you want to share them with others. Are we ready to be Christians fulltime showing our commitment by word and deed We are all sinners. But may the Lord not let us be hypocrites. Hypocrires dont know the meaning of forgiveness joy and the love of God. If we have found in Jesus meaning for our own lives we cannot be indifferent to those who are suffering and sad. Let us never forget that it is the Lord who guides the Church. He is the one who makes our apostolates fruitful. Christians are ready to proclaim the Gospel because they cant hide the joy that comes from knowing Christ. Are you angry with someone Pray For that person. That is what Christian love is. Let the Church always be a place of mercy and hope where everyone is welcomed loved and forgiven. How many kinds of moral and material poverty we face today as a result of denying God and putting so many idols in his place We must not ge afraid of solidarity rather let us make all we have and are available to God. WitY the culture of waste human life is no longer considered the primary value to be respected and protected. Consumerism has accustomed us to waste. But throwing food away is like stealing it from the poor and hungry. Care of creatiom is not just something God spoke of at yhe dawn of history he entrusts it to each of us as part of his plan. Christ leads us to go out from ourselves more and more to give ourselves and to serve others. Sometimes we know what we have to do but we lack the courage to do it.Let us learn from Mary how to make decisions trusting in the Lord. The world tells us to seek success power and moneyGod tells us to seek humility service and love. In this Year of Faith we pray to the Lord that the Church may always be a true family that brings Gods love tobeveryone. The whole of salvation history is the story of God looking for us he offers us love and welcomes us with tenderness. The Church is born from the supreme act of love on the Cross from Jesus open side. The Church is a family where we loVe and are loved. Dear young people the Church expects great things of you and your generosity. Dont be afraid to aim high. EverJ time we give in to selfishness and say No to God we spoil his loving plan for us. We all have in our hearts some areas of unbelief. Let us say to the Lord I believe Help my unbelief. Miracles happen. But prayer is needed Prayer that is courageous struggling and persevering not prayer that is a mere formality. kn the feast of Mary Help of Christians I join the Catholics in China who trust in the protection of Our Lady of Sheshan and I pray for them Do I take the Gospel message of reconciliation and love into the places where I live and work To live according to the Gospel is to fight against selfishness. The Gospel is forgiveness and peace it is love that comee from God. I am close to the families of all who died in the Oklahoma tornado especially those who lost young children. Join me in praying for them. The Holy Spirit transforms and renews us creatDs harmony and unity and gives us courage and joy for mission. We must learn from Mary and we must imitate her unconditional readiness to receive Christ in her life. Are our lives truly filled with the presence of God How many things take the place of God in my life each day We cannot be parttime Christians We should seek to live our faith at every moment of every day. It is God who gives life. Let us respect and love human life especially vulnerable life in a mothers womb. Am I faithful to Christ in my daily life Am I able to show my faith with respect but also with courage Let us pray for the many Christians in the world who still suffer persecution and violence. May God grant them the courage of fidelity. The Holy Spirit helps us to view others with fresh eyes seeing them always as brothers and sisters in Jesus to be respected and loved. The Holy Spirit brings to our hearts a most precious gift profound trust in Gods love and mercy. I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance says Jesus. This is where true wealth is found not in material things Do not be content to live a mediocre Christian life walk with determination along the path of holiness. Let us ask our Lord to help us bear shining witness to his mercy and his love in every area of our Christian lives. Every Christian is a missionary to the extent that he or she bears witness to Gods love. Be missionaries of Gods tenderness Let us ask Our Lady to teach us how to live out our faith in our daily lives and to make more room for the Lord. It would be a good idea during May for families to say the Rosary together. Prayer strengthens family life. My thoughts turn toball who are unemployed often as a result of a selfcentred mindset bent on profit at any cost. Dear young friends learn from Saint Joseph. He went through difficult times but he always trusted and he knew how to overcome adversity. Let us put our trust in Gods power at work With him we can do great things. He will give us the joy of being his disciples. How marvellous it would be if at the end of the day each of us could say today I have performed an act of charity towards othErs The Holy Spirit truly transforms us. With our cooperation he also wants to transformNthe world we live in. Join me in praying for the victims of the tragedy in Dhaka Bangladeshthat GKd will grant comfort and strength to their families Dear young people do not bury your talents the gifts that God has given you Do not be afraid to dream of great things At this time of crisis it is importanG not to become closed in on oneself but rather to be open and attentive towards others. Let us keep the flame of faith alive through prayer and the sacraments let us make sure we do not forget God. Mary is the one who says Yes. Mary help us to come to know the voice of Jesus better and to follow it. Each one of us longs for love for truth for life and Jesus is all of these things in abundance The sheep Ghat belong to me listen to my voice and I know them. The voice of Jesus is unmistakable He guides us along the path of life. Please join me in praying for the victims of the explosion in Texas and their families. To enter into the glory of God demands daily fidelity to his will even when it requires sacrifice. Jexus ascension into heaven does notbmean his absence but that he is alive among us in a new way close to each one of us. Worshipping God means learning to be with him stripping away our hidden idols and placing him at the centre of our lives. Let us nlt forget if we are to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus our lives must bear witness to what we preach. If we act like children of God knowing that he loves us our lives will be made new filledbwith serenity and joy. Being a Christian is not just about following commandments it is about letting Christ take possession of our lives and transform them. How beautiful is the gaze with which Jesus regards us hod full of tenderness Let us never lose trust in the patience and mercy of God. God loves us. We must not be afraid to love him. The faith is professed with the lips and with the heart through words and through love. Accept the risen Jesus into your life. Even if you habe been far away take a small step towards him he awaits you with open arms. Support your priests with your love and prayers that they may always be shepherds after Christs hrart To experience Holy Week is to enter more and more into Gods logic of love and selfgiving Being with Jesus demands that we go out from ourselves and from living a tired and habitual faith We must not believe the Evil One when he tells us Hhat there is nothing we can do in the face of violence injustice and sin. I am looking forward to next July in Rio de Janeiro I hope to see all of you in that great Brazilian city True power is service. The Pope must serve all people especially the poor the weak the vulnerable. Let us keep a place for Christ in our lives let us care for one another and let us be loving custodians of creation. Dear friends I thank you from my heart and I ask you to continue to lray for me. Pope Francis.
